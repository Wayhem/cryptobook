### Folder Structure

For this project I used a CSS and Component based architecture called [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), even thought it is more of a design and layout oriented architecture, you can see some advantages when making a react application.

### To Do and Issues:

- Add some UI interaction tests
- Typing of styled components
- Tests around websocket hook
